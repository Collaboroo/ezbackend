# Overview

<!-- URGENT TODO: Make all code snippets long and short version -->


The basic building block of EzBackend is the EzApp

![EzApp](./assets/ez-app.png)

```ts
const app = new EzApp()
```

The EzApp can have child EzApps, and any options specified on an EzApp will propagate to all its children.

![EzApp Prefix Example](./assets/app-prefix-example.png)

```ts
const leftApp = new EzApp()
const userApp = new EzApp()
app.addApp("Left App", leftApp)
app.addApp("Right App", userApp, {prefix:'users'})
```

In the above example, the EzApp has no route prefix, so all http routes on it will have the prefix `/`

However, the EzApp on the right was added to the parent with the route prefix `users`, so all its children will have the prefix `/users/`

![EzBackend as Parent](./assets/ezbackend-as-parent.png)

```ts
const ezb = new EzBackend()

const app = new EzApp()

ezb.addApp("Version 1", app, {prefix: 'v1'})
.
.
app.addApp(...)
.
.
ezb.start()
```

The topmost parent of an EzBackend must be a `EzBackend`, as the parent EzBackend runs the initialization code in its lifecycle for all child apps to work.
