<CodeSnippet
sample={`app.addApp(new EzCors())`}
fullCode={`import { EzBackend } from '@ezbackend/common'
import { EzCors } from "@ezbackend/cors";\n
const app = new EzBackend()\n
app.addApp(new EzCors())\n
app.start()`}
/>

## Configuration

All plugins are designed to be fully extensible and configurable. You can view the configuration options [here](../configuration)
