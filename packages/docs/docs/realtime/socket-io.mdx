# Socket IO

import CodeSnippet from "../CodeSnippet.jsx";

EzBackend uses socket.io for realtime functionality under the hood.

## Accessing Socket IO

You can access the socket io instance from any `EzApp` or class that extends `EzApp`, for example `EzBackend`

### From Request

You can get the non-namespaced [io object](https://socket.io/docs/v4/server-instance/) from `req`

```ts

```

### Non Namespaced

You can get the equivalent of the [io object](https://socket.io/docs/v4/server-instance/) from any EzApp with

<CodeSnippet
  sample={`app.useSocketIORaw((io) => {/* Your Custom Functionality */})`}
  fullCode={`import { EzBackend } from "@ezbackend/common"\n
const app = new EzBackend()\n
app.useSocketIORaw((io) => {
    io.on("connect", (socket) => {
        console.log("Client Connected: ", socket.id)
    })
})\n
app.start()`}
/>

### Namespaced

An EzApp's prefix affects the namespacing of subsequent commands. the below `io` instance is under the namespace `/users`

<CodeSnippet
  sample={`users.useSocketIO((io) => {/* Your Custom Functionality */})
app.addApp(users, {prefix: "users"})`}
  fullCode={`import { EzBackend,EzApp } from "@ezbackend/common"\n
const app = new EzBackend()
const users = new EzApp()\n
users.useSocketIO((io) => {
    io.on("connect", (socket) => {
        console.log("Client Connected to Users Namespace: ", socket.id)
    })
})\n
app.addApp(users, {prefix: "users"})\n
app.start()`}
/>

For more information on socket io namespacing refer to the [socket io docs](https://socket.io/docs/v4/namespaces/)

## Why Socket IO

We chose socket.io instead of websockets or long polling because it is

1. More opinionated. Socket IO comes with the concept of namespaces and rooms, meaning that you don't have to come up with your own system that is probably not as good
2. Browser Support. Socket IO comes with fallbacks to long polling if the browser does not support websockets, which in turn means that EzBackend can support requests from more browsers.
