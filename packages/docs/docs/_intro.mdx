# Introduction

EzBackend lets you develop your idea, in **less lines of code**.

## Philosophy

1. The developer is always right

- Whatever the developer thinks is the right code, should be the right code.

2. Error messages should be stack overflow worthy

- Errors shouldn't result in a trip to stack overflow

3. Simplicity at its core

- If something can be implemented with less code, it shall be.
